        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
          2-3 large eggs
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Salt , to taste
        </ul>
        <ul>
          Pepper , to taste
        </ul>
        <ul>
          1 tablespoon of butter or oil

        <ul>
          Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegetables, cooked meats, herbs
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <ol>
          Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and
          pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or
          milk for a fluffier texture.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add
          butter or oil.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the
          eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but
          are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings
          over one half of the omelette.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one
          edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute,
          then slide it onto a plate.
        </ol>
        <ol>
          Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
        </ol>
